# OVERVIEW
#
# pykar is a MIDI/KAR karaoke player built using python. It was written for
# the PyKaraoke project but is in fact a general purpose KAR player that
# could be used in other python projects requiring a KAR player.
#
# The player uses the pygame library (www.pygame.org), and can therefore
# run on any operating system that runs pygame (currently Linux, Windows
# and OSX).
#
# You can use this file as a standalone player, or together with
# PyKaraoke. PyKaraoke provides a graphical user interface, playlists,
# searchable song database etc.
#
# For those writing a media player or similar project who would like
# KAR support, this module has been designed to be easily incorporated
# into such projects and is released under the LGPL.


# REQUIREMENTS
#
# pykar requires the following to be installed on your system:
# . Python (www.python.org)
# . Pygame (www.pygame.org)


# LINUX REQUIREMENTS
#
# To play the MIDI songs on Linux, Timidity++ is also required:
# . Timidity++ (timidity.sourceforge.net)

# OSX REQUIREMENTS
#
# On OSX, pygame will run MIDI natively by default, but if the GUS
# patches are installed in /usr/local/lib/timidity, it will run MIDI
# via Timidity instead, which appears to work better than the native
# support, so we recommend this.

# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
#
# To start the player, pass the KAR filename/path on the command line:
#       python pykar.py /songs/theboxer.kar
#
# You can also incorporate a KAR player in your own projects by
# importing this module. The class midPlayer is exported by the
# module. You can import and start it as follows:
#   import pykar
#   player = pykar.midPlayer("/songs/theboxer.kar")
#   player.Play()
# If you do this, you must also arrange to call pycdg.manager.Poll()
# from time to time, at least every 100 milliseconds or so, to allow
# the player to do its work.
#
# The class also exports Close(), Pause(), Rewind(), GetPos().
#
# There are two optional parameters to the initialiser, errorNotifyCallback
# and doneCallback:
#
# errorNotifyCallback, if provided, will be used to print out any error
# messages (e.g. song file not found). This allows the module to fit
# together well with GUI playlist managers by utilising the same GUI's
# error popup window mechanism (or similar). If no callback is provided,
# errors are printed to stdout. errorNotifyCallback should take one
# parameter, the error string, e.g.:
#   def errorPopup (ErrorString):
#       msgBox (ErrorString)
#
# doneCallback can be used to register a callback so that the player
# calls you back when the song is finished playing. The callback should
# take no parameters, e.g.:
#   def songFinishedCallback():
#       msgBox ("Song is finished")
#
# To register callbacks, pass the functions in to the initialiser:
#   midPlayer ("/songs/theboxer.kar", errorPopup, songFinishedCallback)
# These parameters are optional and default to None.
#
# If the initialiser fails (e.g. the song file is not present), __init__
# raises an exception.


# IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
#
# pykar is implemented as a handful of python modules. Pygame provides
# support for playing MIDI files, so playing a MIDI song using Pygame
# is very easy. However, in order to find the lyrics from the MIDI
# file it was necessary to write a basic parser that understands the
# MIDI file format. This opens the MIDI file and reads all tracks,
# pulling out the lyric text and times. After this first parse of the
# MIDI file, this module does not do any more MIDI decoding for
# playing purposes - Pygame takes care of all actual music generation.
#
# Because a MIDI file might change tempo throughout the song, and
# because tempo changes are technically allowed to appear within any
# track and apply to all tracks, it is necessary to fully parse the
# MIDI file before making observations of tempo, and thus before being
# able to determine the precise time each lyric is to appear onscreen.
# Thus, we initially save only the "click" count of each lyric's
# appearance, and then once the file has been completely read, we can
# convert clicks to milliseconds.
#
# There is an extra complication on Linux which is that the MIDI
# support (provided by Timidity++, which is built into pygame) reports
# the current song time using the first note being played as the
# start. However on Windows the Pygame MIDI player returns the time
# from the start of the actual song (even if there is no sound for a
# few seconds). This meant that for Linux systems, it was necessary to
# parse the whole MIDI file and calculate the time of the first note
# from all tracks. This is then used as an offset in the calculation
# of when to display the lyrics.
#
# Previous implementations ran the player within a thread; this is no
# longer the case.  Instead, it is the caller's responsibility to call
# pykar.manager.Poll() every once in a while to ensure that the player
# gets enough CPU time to do its work.  Ideally, this should be at
# least every 100 milliseconds or so to guarantee good video and audio
# response time.
